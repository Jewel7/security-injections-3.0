The most popular form of authentication in use today is the password.

					"text": "A password is an authentication mechanism used to verify if a user is the legitimate owner of a user ID. Hackers can use attacks, such as brute force (which is a type of attack that relies purely on trial and error) and dictionary attacks (that attempt to crack a password by testing it against a list of dictionary words) to guess your password and use this information to commit illegal or undesirable acts in your name."

					"type": "paragraph",
					"text": "When you use an easily guessed password, such as your user ID, any name, or a word from the dictionary; your password becomes an easy target for brute force and dictionary attacks. When you use a strong password but write it down and stick it to your monitor, place it under your mouse pad, in your drawer or write it in a book; your password could be stolen."

					"text": "On Sunday, January 4th, 2009, a hacker known only as GMZ, used a tool he developed to launch a dictionary attack against the account of a Twitter user named Crystal. The program ran for several hours overnight automatically trying different English words. When “he checked the results Monday morning at around 11:00 a.m. E.T., he found he was in Crystal's account.” GMZ soon realized that Crystal was actually a Twitter staffer with administrative privileges. He was able to compromise several high-profile accounts by resetting their passwords and making them available to fellow hackers. Some of these included the accounts of President Elect Barack Obama, Britney Spears, CBS News and Fox News."
